hi professor,

My name is Mohamed Mohamed and as english being my third langues i could happily say i learned a lot from you and from working with my class mates. It was thanks to you and your words of advise that made me believe i can get a good job and go anywhere it was thanks to linux, i landed a job in the states and without your encouragement i would not have landed one. That aside, the ubuntu you helped me install i use it everyday in my daily life and i even installed it in the devices in my house and currently teaching my brother about linux creating files and using the sudo command an creating a server. without your hard work you committed to us in class this would not happened, and i deeply thank you so so much.
The effort i put in class was a lot even in my work place and home i use linux, to learn new things now im doing research about linux security and hopefully ill take your security class next semester. The grade i should receive is an A- because i tried my best and because of you i love linux, and without your hardwork and mines this would've not happened . I will always use linux in my daily life until my last breath. 

thank you professor ,
